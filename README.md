Implements a neural network algorithm in TensorFlow that uses wavelets to reconstruct images and other data. The model operates by outputting reasonable estimates of the wavelet coefficients when given a set of corresponding scale coefficients as an input. The algorithm can be be used for generative modeling, with the latent space being the space of scale coefficients at an approapriate level of coarse-graining. Since the wavelet decomposition will significantly lower the dimension of the original data, it is possible to use a simple distribution, such as a Gaussian, to sample from the latent space and generate complex reconstructed outputs. 

The `walkthrough.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains a description of the neural network model and a tutorial on its use. The full source code is contained in the `wavelet.py` and `mnist_model.py` modules in the `src` folder. A suitable virtual environment can be set up using the `requirements.txt` file (the `requirements.in` file lists the direct dependencies).
